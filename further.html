      <p class = "about"></br></br>
        My name is Aarushi Ammavajjala, and I am a student in the Forsyth County School District in Georgia. Growing up in a more rural state always kept me aware of where my food comes from. I often visited local farms, and learned the stories behind the food on my dinner table.
        </br></br>
        Recently, I've become more aware of climate change and its effects. Everyone knows about climate change, but very few people want to take action. I decided I wanted to be the exception. I started researching about greenhouse gases, methane, and the sources of methane - which lead me right to my bovine friends.
        </br></br>
        I was so inspired to not only make this website, but actively make an impact in my community. Once the website is online, I plan to take the volunteering organization I am part of to visit organic cattle farms around our area. I am already in conversation with over five farms about reducing their methane footprints, and would love to connect more farmers with resources. We will discuss possible solutions and raising funding for investment with as many farms as we can.
        </br></br>
        By reading this website, you have helped take one more step in the climate race, and for that, I thank you.
        </br></br>
        Sincerely, </br>
        Aarushi Ammavajjala
