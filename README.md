# SmartCow
SmartCow is my web development submission for Metrohacks' Empowher 2022.

The Images folder holds all the images used in this project, credit given in the Images Bibliograhy.
The SmartCow.zip file is a zipped file of the full website, download from Replit, the IDE I created the site on.
The further.html file contains the code for the second page of my website, with the slideshow, contact form, and bibliography. 
Index.html is the code for the home page of my website. It is the majority of the content, including the title, introduction to methane, and the solution explanations.
Script.js houses the Javascript code for both pages.
Finally, Style.css is the page coding for all the design/formatting on both pages of the website.
